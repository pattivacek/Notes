Enable core dumping (use -Hc or -Sc to set hard/soft limits; leave off value to query the current value):
ulimit -c unlimited
Print out all shell resource limits:
ulimit -a
Check where dump files are written to (make sure the location is writable by the desired user):
cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
Open a new shell with a new ulimit set by root:
sudo su -c "ulimit -u unlimited && exec su $LOGNAME"
Check here for ulimit restrictions (as well as .bashrc and .profile):
/etc/security/limits.conf
Check here for setuid programs (0 to disable, 1 to fully enable for debugging, 2 to create dump as root):
/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
Test to see if dumping is working:
sleep 100 & kill -s SEGV %1


RedHat-based systems use the file /etc/sysconfig/network to read the saved hostname at system boot. This is set using the init script /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
Use 'hostname <name>' to change the hostname, or with no argument to print the current hostname.
Individual interfaces can be manually edited at this location: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*

SSH to multiple ports on the same host without warnings:

Logout of the server and ssh back with a new port and temporary known_hosts file:

A new fingerprint prompt should appear. Accept it. Logout and copy the new fingerprint to the existing known_hosts file:

Some Valgrind notes:
  $ valgrind --leak-check=full --db-attach=yes --track-fds=yes --log-socket=<my-ip-address> <program>

This tells valgrind that I have started valgrind-listener in another terminal,
so all valgrind related output should go there.  This makes sure that valgrind
output isn't confused with program output. It also tells valgrind to ask me
whether I want to use GDB to look at any errors that occur.

 * --db-attach is now deprecated and will be removed in the next
  valgrind feature release.  The built-in GDB server capabilities are
  superior and should be used instead. Learn more here:
  http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.gdbserver

Valgrind as profiler:
  $ valgrind --tool=callgrind --cache-sim=yes --branch-sim=yes --dump-instr=yes --collect-jumps=yes <program>
  $ kcachgrind

LD_LIBRARY_PATH not respected due to RPATH issues:

Use ldd to check what dynamic libraries are used for a given executable.
If that isn't what is expected, try 'LD_DEBUG=all ldd <binary>'.

Shared libraries are found by searching the following paths:
1. The RPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if present and RUNPATH attribute does not exist.
2. The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If the executable is a set-user-ID/set-group-ID binary, this is ignored.
3. The RUNPATH dynamic section attribute of the binary if present.
4. The cache file /etc/ld.so.cache which contains a compiled list of candidate libraries previously found in the augmented library path. If, however, the  binary was linked with -z nodeflib linker option, libraries in the default library paths are skipped.
5. The default path /lib, and then /usr/lib. If the binary was linked with -z nodeflib linker option, this step is skipped.

To check if RPATH is set, try this:
readelf -a <binary> | grep RPATH

To force setting (or not setting) the RPATH, set (or unset) the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable.


Sticky bit, setuid, and setgid:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid
When a directory's sticky bit is set, the filesystem treats the files in such directories in a special way so only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or root user can rename or delete the file. Without the sticky bit set, any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files, regardless of the file's owner. The Linux kernel ignores the sticky bit on files.
In Unix symbolic file system permission notation, the sticky bit is represented by the letter t in the final character-place.
If the sticky-bit is set on a file or directory without the execution bit set for the others category (non-user-owner and non-group-owner), it is indicated with a capital T.
The sticky bit can be set using the chmod command and can be set using its octal mode 1000 or by its symbol t.
setuid and setgid (short for "set user ID upon execution" and "set group ID upon execution", respectively) are Unix access rights flags that allow users to run an executable with the permissions of the executable's owner or group respectively.
Setting the setgid permission on a directory ("chmod g+s") causes new files and subdirectories created within it to inherit its group ID, rather than the primary group ID of the user who created the file (the owner ID is never affected, only the group ID). Newly created subdirectories inherit the setgid bit. 
The setuid and setgid bits are normally set with the command chmod by setting the high-order octal digit to 4 for setuid or 2 for setgid (or chmod ug+s).


Remove executable bit recursively on all files, excepting directories, and only if the bit is set:
http://superuser.com/questions/234647/how-to-remove-executable-bit-recursively-from-files-not-directories
find . -type f -perm +111 -exec chmod -x {} \;
If that doesn't work, try searching with:
find . -type f -perm -g=w

find . -name '.*' 


Fix image metadata (remove unsafe EXIF tags):
exiftool -all= -tagsfromfile @ -all:all -unsafe <file>

Fix image metadata dates:

exiftool "-FileModifyDate<QuickTime:CreateDate" <file>


Generate a flac fingerprint file:
metaflac --show-md5sum *.flac > fingerprints.ffp
