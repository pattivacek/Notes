% Add line break with \\. To control additional space, for example:
\\[10pt]

% To control spacing after a command, it is recommended not to put a space at the end of
% the command itself, but instead always close a no-argument command with {}
% anyway. Use '\ ' to add a space if necessary. For example:
\newcommand{\libdde}{\texttt{libdde}}
The implementation is known as \libdde{}.

% Explicit space; prevent line break between words:
~

% Prevent extra space (full stop) after a period, use '\ '. Also note that a
% comma after the period prevents the spacing issue, although parentheses do
% not. If the character before the period is a capital letter, it is assumed to
% be an initial and the logic is circumvented. To force the extra space, use
% '\@.'. Note that question marks and exclamation points are treated the same
% as periods.

% Inline math:
\(...\)     % Plain TeX (not recommended in LaTeX) is $...$
% Displayed math (separate from main text):
\[...\]     % Plain TeX (not recommended in LaTeX) is $$...$$

% Ellipses: do not use '...', this will be too tightly spaced. Use \ldots,
% which may require forced spaces before or after ('\ ').

% Hyphens and dashes:
Use - for hypenated words (daughter-in-law).
Use -- for en-dashes, used in ranges (pages 5--7).
Use --- for em-dashes, used as punctuation between phrases ("A specter is haunting Europe---the specter of Communism.")
Use math mode or $-5$ for a minus sign.
