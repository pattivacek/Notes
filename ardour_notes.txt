To setup Ardour + JACK, start here:
http://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html

Basically, add this:
@realtime   -  rtprio     99
@realtime   -  memlock    unlimited
to /etc/security/limits.d/99-realtime.conf

Then, as root:
groupadd realtime
usermod -a -G realtime yourUserID
usermod -a -G realtime yourUserId

Log out and back in.

Launch qjackctl. Click Setup.
Set Input Device and Output Device to be hw:USB (or whatever the external interface is).
Press Start.

Launch Ardour. Start a new session.
Make sure master bus has two channels to get mono (or any) panning to work correctly.
Select "Automatically connect to physical inputs", optionally use one 1 channel (?)
Select "Automatically connect outputs" and "...to master bus"


To run sound from VLC through JACK:
sudo apt-get install vlc-plugin-jack
vlc --aout jack
