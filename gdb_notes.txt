Use the x command to examine memory:
x/nfu addr
x addr
x

n, f, and u are all optional parameters that specify how much memory to display and how to format it; addr is an expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory. If you use defaults for nfu, you need not type the slash `/'. Several commands set convenient defaults for addr.

n, the repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1. It specifies how much memory (counting by units u) to display.

f, the display format is one of the formats used by print, `s' (null-terminated string), or `i' (machine instruction). The default is `x' (hexadecimal) initially. The default changes each time you use either x or print.

u, the unit size is any of
    b Bytes.
    h Halfwords (two bytes).
    w Words (four bytes). This is the initial default.
    g Giant words (eight bytes).

Each time you specify a unit size with x, that size becomes the default unit the next time you use x. (For the `s' and `i' formats, the unit size is ignored and is normally not written.)
